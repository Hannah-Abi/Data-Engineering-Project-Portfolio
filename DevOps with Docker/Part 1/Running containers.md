## Images and containers 
- Containers are instances of images
-  A container = a ready-to-eat meal. An image = the recipe or ingredients for that meal.
-  You need **an image** and **a container runtime (Docker engine)** to create a container. The image provides all the necessary instructions and dependencies for the container to run, just like a recipe provides the steps and ingredients to make a meal.
