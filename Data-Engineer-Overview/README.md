# Data Engineering Course README

Welcome to our Data Engineering Course! This is a conceptual course designed to provide a solid understanding of data engineering, without involving coding. Whether you're a developer or not, our objective is to equip you with the knowledge to engage with a data engineering team effectively.

## Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Engineering
This chapter clarifies the fundamentals of data engineering, its relation to big data, and the distinctions between data engineers and data scientists. It concludes with an exploration of data pipelines.

### Chapter 2: Data Storage
Building on the foundations, this chapter delves into data storage, covering various data structures, the central role of SQL, and different storage solutions.

### Chapter 3: Data Processing
The third chapter focuses on processing methods and tools, including scheduling, parallel computing, and cloud computing.

## Data Workflow

Understanding the flow of data within an organization is crucial. The course covers the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Ingestion:** Gather data from sources such as web traffic, surveys, or media consumption.

2. **Data Storage:** Raw data is stored and then prepared, including cleaning and organization.

3. **Data Exploitation:** Explore, visualize, and build dashboards to extract insights from the organized data.

4. **Experimentation:** Once familiar with the data, run experiments, such as evaluating popular article titles or building predictive models.

## The Role of Data Engineers

Data engineers play a pivotal role in the data workflow. They are responsible for ingesting and storing collected data, laying the groundwork for data analysts, scientists, and machine learning engineers. Their responsibilities include optimizing databases, managing data corruption, and developing architectures for large-scale processing systems.

## Big Data and the Five Vs

With the advent of big data, the demand for data engineers has increased. Big data is characterized by five Vs:

- **Volume:** The quantity of data points.
- **Variety:** Type and nature of the data (text, image, video, audio).
- **Velocity:** How fast the data is generated and processed.
- **Veracity:** Trustworthiness of the data sources.
- **Value:** How actionable the data is.

Data engineers must consider these factors while working with big data.
